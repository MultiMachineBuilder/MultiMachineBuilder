 * coulombs (electric charge of batteries)
 * joules (energy)
 * volts (voltages)
 * amps (amperage)
 * cubic meters (storage space)
 * liters/cubits (fluids and dusts)
 * grams (mass)
 * 
 * The cubits and liters are an exception to other units since they are base 1024, use binary prefixes and are always integer multiples of a liter
